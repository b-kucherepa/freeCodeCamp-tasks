            <p>The Knight is a Vessel, a being made of Void. The Knight, as well as the other Vessels, were creations of
                the Pale King of Hollownest in his attempt to seal away the Radiance, the previous ruler of Hallownest,
                as she had the ability to break through minds and turn the bugs into hostile, mindless monsters. As a
                Vessel, it was their duty to seal away the Infection without thought for the Radiance to be able to
                break through. The Knight was born in the Abyss littered with deceased bodies of their Vessel siblings.
                Upon making it to the top of the Abyss, they watch the Pale King guide the chosen Vessel, the Hollow
                Knight, out into Hallownest before plummeting back down into the Abyss. Sometime after the Hollow Knight
                was sealed in the Black Egg, the Knight managed to make it out of the Abyss and escape Hallownest.</p>
